# Cinema booking system
A basic cinema booking system made with Python

The project was made during my very first year at university in a group of 2. This was my first programming project. One of the prerequisites for the assignment was to be able to open and edit files with Python. In our case use them as a very simple local database for saving seat reservations of a cinema.

Install and use:
Make sure that all .py and all .csv files needs to be in the same directory:
•	yllapitajan_kayttoliittyma.py
•	kayttajan_kayttoliittyma.py
•	varaukset_klo_12.csv
•	varaukset_klo_14.csv
•	varaukset_klo_16.csv
Run kayttajan_kayttoliittyma.py or yllapitajan_kayttoliittyma.py and follow the instructions.
